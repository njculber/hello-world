# hello-world
The hello-world repository was built to learn the basics of Github and for the class Team Software Project.

This repository was built by Neil Culbertson on January 17, 2016.

Making some changes in the readme-edits branch. I'm 21 years old, I like photography/videography, I play a lot of the known sports except Football & Hockey. I like adventures, I tend to avoid planning things, because I like when things happen spontanously.
